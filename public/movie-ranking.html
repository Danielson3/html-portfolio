<h3>Old Yeller</h3>
<p>I remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was an interesting show. </p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This was one of the few movies I saw in a theater. It was a dramatic movie to watch in the theater.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Great movie! Why, well obviously a huge lesson in messing with nature and being overconfident. </p>
